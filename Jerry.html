                                Jerry, along with the other Minions, is enjoying a big ice cream party. He and Kevin have been assigned by Gru to watch over the girls and put them to bed.

                                After Jerry sings them a lullaby, they decide to play a round of golf. Instead of using a regular tee, the golf ball is placed in Jerry's mouth, but Kevin mischievously plans to hit Jerry on the head instead of the ball. Their game is interrupted by a strange noise, prompting a nervous Jerry and Kevin to head outside to investigate. They soon discover it's just a cat rummaging through the garbage. Kevin mocks Jerry for getting scared over nothing, which leads to a fight between the two. However, their brawl is interrupted by a bright light shining from above. Kevin lets go of Jerry, and he floats up into the light.

                                Later on, Jerry is seen at the beach, which turns out to be part of Eduardo's lab, happily playing his guitar.

                                At the end of the movie, Jerry joins Kevin, Stuart, and Dave to sing "I Swear."

                            <p>
                                Jerry first appears during a snowball fight, where he's seen acting as a clown. While Kevin is off searching for a new boss, Jerry, along with other Minions and Dave (the leader of their tribe), encounters the Yetis. He's seen singing, dancing, and enjoying himself with the group. Later, he is spotted traveling, including a moment in the subway. Jerry makes his final appearance during Kevin, Stuart, and Bob's celebration, where he's part of the entire Minion tribe chasing after Felonius Gru.

                                Later, Jerry is seen in the rain with Mel, Kevin, Tom, Carl, and the other Minions when they encounter Fritz, who shows them a picture of Gru and asks about his whereabouts. The Minions deny knowing anything and start spitting at Fritz. As they leave, Jerry stomps on the picture and continues spitting on it before walking away.

                                The next morning, Jerry is walking with Stuart and the other Minions and complains to Mel that he's hungry. Soon after, the group spots a pizza delivery truck and chases after it, only to get caught by policemen with two German Shepherds. They are taken to a stage, where Jerry stands next to Mel, and they are forced to sing. During the performance, Jerry, Stuart, and Kevin are dressed as women and dance with smiley faces on their rears. After the song ends, they are apprehended by the police.

                                At the State Prison, Jerry is seen wearing black-and-white striped overalls with the number 069 on them. He steals a dollar from another prisoner, and Mel draws a banana with wings on Jerry's back. Jerry snaps his fingers along with the other Minions, and when a basketball rolls by, he kicks it at a fellow prisoner. He also makes a brief appearance in the shower with other Minions, while Stuart slaps another inmate. Later, Jerry is seen alongside Kevin, Mel, Tom, and Peter as they plan their escape. He sings while playing with dead crabs and is briefly seen when Mel unleashes the Minions.

                                After the final battle, Jerry lands on a rock. By the end of the film, he is seen joining a pillow fight and is later shown peacefully sleeping in bed.

                                Jerry appears in Minions: The Rise of Gru, where he is shown working alongside the other Minions in Gru's secret lab. He is also seen standing with the other Minions during various moments, and is briefly spotted when they are out in the rain (possibly).

                                Jerry is highly sensitive, as shown when Kevin teases him about being a coward. He also gets easily frightened by unusual sounds, like when he was startled by a noise that turned out to be just a cat rummaging through the garbage. Despite this, he has a passion for playing his guitar, which is evident from his performance at the beach.
