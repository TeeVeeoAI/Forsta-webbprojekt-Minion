                            <p>
                                When Gru sets his telephone on fire, Carl rushes into Gru's office, acting as a fire siren alongside Samson and Donald, who are dressed in firefighter attire and trying to extinguish the flames. Gru, clearly annoyed, snatches the megaphone from Carl and leaves the room. Undeterred, Carl continues to mimic the fire siren sound at the same loud volume, much to Stuart's irritation. In response, Stuart grabs a fire extinguisher and sprays Carl out of the room.

                                Because of this incident, Carl is often referred to as the "Beedo Minion."

                                When Gru and Lucy were trying to catch Balthazar Bratt, Carl joined the mission along with Jorge. After Lucy blasted Gru's hydrocycle with the Minions, Gru ended up landing on a ship, while Carl and Jorge landed on the beach. There, they began to act like DJs, adding to the fun and excitement of the moment.

                                Carl first appears watching Gru yell at Otto, and he can be seen laughing at a picture of Gru. He also appears when Kevin runs up to answer a phone call from Wild Knuckles. Additionally, Carl is present at Wild Knuckles' funeral, where he is depicted as an angel. He is easily identifiable throughout these scenes.

                                Carl is seen in the credits playing ping pong with Phil, Mega Tim, and Mega Gus. This playful moment adds to the fun and lightheartedness of the film's conclusion.

                                Carl is a small, one-eyed Minion with spiky hair, though in later films he sports a buzz-cut. He is known for wearing flashing lights on his head and carrying a megaphone, through which he repeatedly says "Bee-do" when trying to imitate a siren.
