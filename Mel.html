                                    In the film's storyline, Mel takes the lead as the head of the Minions and the central figure in their subplot. Gru, having retired from his villainous ways, is now out of a job with the Anti-Villain League. The Minions, eager for him to embrace his former villainy, decide to rebel when Gru declines their wishes. Led by Mel, they consider leaving Gru for another villain, except for Dave and Jerry, who just arrive at the lab after a performance for Gru's family.

                                    After quitting Gru, the Minions find themselves caught in a downpour. While wandering, they encounter Dru's butler, Fritz, who is searching for Gru's address. Angered, Mel and the other Minions refuse to help Fritz locate Gru.

                                    The following morning, still angry and hungry, the Minions chase down a pizza delivery guy. In the process, they accidentally wander into a TV studio lot, prompting a police chase. They try to hide but end up on a set for a singing competition, where they perform a Minionese version of the iconic patter song "I Am The Very Model of a Modern Major General," which they call "Papa Mama Loca Pipa." The judges and audience love it, but soon after, the Minions are arrested.

                                    While in prison, Mel realizes just how much he misses Gru. The Minions band together to build a plane for their escape. They manage to flee at night, but one Minion stays behind to signal the aircraft. Mel, now piloting the plane, spots Gru, Lucy, and Dru, and they follow them to Hollywood to thwart Bratt's bubble-gum scheme. Although their efforts are mostly ineffective, they do manage to pop the bubbles before they can lift Hollywood into space.

                                    In the end, Mel reconciles with Gru, and they return to Gru's family along with Dru. After Lucy settles the girls and Gru calls the Minions and Dru to sleep, Mel and the other Minions shed their dungarees as Dru takes the helm of Gru's airship, which now sports a "D" emblem, continuing the family tradition.

                                In the film, Mel transforms into a Mega Minion due to an experiment with the Super-Serum, gaining a powerful laser in his eye capable of cutting through the earth. When the microwave is damaged, Mel assists Mike by using his laser to heat his coffee. However, it gets too hot and shatters the cup, leading to further chaos as he accidentally destroys a glass window, an igloo, and a satellite. He even makes a brief appearance in the end credits, where he gets startled and accidentally shoots a laser at Gus.

In addition, he was like a villain minion who didn't pay attention to the poor and hungry minions on the street of Los Angeles at all.
