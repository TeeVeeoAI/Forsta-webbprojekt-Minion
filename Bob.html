                                Bob possibly appeared in Despicable Me, but he is only mentioned by name in the end credits of the film.

                                Bob first appears during the credits of Despicable Me 2, where he is auditioning for the spin-off film Minions alongside Kevin and Stuart. In this scene, he is playful and often annoys Kevin with his antics. At one point, he attempts to attack a butterfly but fails and accidentally falls into the void.
                                <br>
                                In this appearance, Bob looks similar to Jerry, but without hair. His green eye is also slightly lighter, giving him a distinct look among the Minions.

                            <p>
                                Bob is the only Minion who shows interest in Kevin's journey, and after pleading with him, he is allowed to join. During their adventure, Kevin occasionally carries Bob, who grows tired and hungry. At one point, he and Stuart humorously try to eat Kevin, leading to a hallucination where Stuart imagines that the Minions are bananas.
                                <br>
                                Upon arriving in New York, Bob becomes fascinated by a parade protesting against war, holding a sign that says "BOO-YA!" Later, while visiting an album store, he follows a female customer whose clothing is covered in banana designs. Unfortunately, Bob accidentally gets into a taxi with her baggage. When the woman realizes Bob is in her bag, she screams and throws him and his teddy bear out.
                                <br>
                                Bob then enters a department store while Kevin and Stuart search for him. Kevin grabs the store's loudspeaker and calls out for Bob, who mistakenly thinks Kevin is in a changing room. Inside, he sees his reflection in the mirrors and, believing it to be his friends, runs into them, realizing they're just reflections. When Kevin finds him, Bob expresses how much he misses the tribe, and Kevin hands him his teddy bear just before the lights go out.

                                Excited to see information from VNC, a top-secret channel about villains, Bob attends Villain-Con, where he meets Professor Flux, the inventor of a time machine. Tragically, the professor is killed by one of his future avatars. During Scarlet Overkill's speech, Bob inadvertently wins her challenge and receives a ruby. In the chaos that follows, he accidentally swallows the ruby while trying to retrieve his teddy bear.

                                In London, Bob is given a Stretch Suit by Herb Overkill to help steal Queen Elizabeth II's crown. Using the suit, he wields Arthur Pendragon's sword from the stone, leading to Elizabeth's abdication and Bob being crowned the new King of England. His crowning moment at Buckingham Palace is a highlight. However, Scarlet and Herb later arrive at the palace, and Bob abdicates in her favor, but she then sends him, along with Kevin and Stuart, to be tortured.
                                <br>
                                After escaping the torture room, the trio attends Scarlet's coronation at Westminster Abbey, where they accidentally drop a chandelier on her. While hiding from various villains, Bob gets captured by HY.

                                The next day, Bob and Stuart find themselves tied to a pile of explosives set by the Overkills, but Kevin breaks in and saves them. After briefly believing Kevin has died due to Scarlet's missile during the fight, Bob is the first to mourn him. Fortunately, Kevin survives and returns to his normal size, bringing Bob's teddy bear back with him.

                                At the end of the movie, Queen Elizabeth II thanks Bob for his service as king and rewards him with a tiny crown for his teddy bear, Cheerio Bear. Bob hugs her in gratitude, then gives the crown to Scarlet out of pity and bids her farewell. He ultimately joins the Minion tribe in pursuit of Felonius Gru.

                                Bob first appears in the rain alongside Kevin, Stuart, Mark, and Tom, where he cheers while Kevin, Stuart, and Jerry sing. Unfortunately, he gets caught by the police and ends up in State Prison. Inside, he is seen in a cell. Later, he finds himself at the bottom of a plane with Kevin, Stuart, Jerry, and the rest of the Minions, where he is sleeping. In the end, Bob is one of the Minions who does not accompany Dru.

                                Bob first appears alongside Stuart and Kevin as they fetch a young Gru from school and head to the theater to watch Jaws, using a fart bomb to ward off other moviegoers. After the movie, they visit an arcade and later an ice cream shop, where Bob leaves a stuffed toy in the tip jar. They taunt some gym-goers with their ice cream before returning home, where they find a message from the Vicious 6, announcing that they've been accepted for an interview.
                                <br>
                                Later that night, Bob, having had a nightmare, asks Gru if he can sleep with him. Although Gru is skeptical about the nightmare, he allows Bob, along with Kevin and Stuart, to join him in bed.

                                The next day, the Minion trio decides to follow Gru to his interview, despite his insistence that they stay home. They manage to distract Otto along the way, but he finds them nonetheless. When Gru is pursued by the Vicious 6 after a disastrous interview, they all hop on Gru's jet bike. Unfortunately, Otto accidentally trades the Zodiac Stone for a pet rock, forcing Gru to fire the Minions before fleeing to retrieve the stone himself.

                                After a chaotic night, the Minions receive a phone call from Wild Knuckles, who demands the Zodiac Stone as ransom for Gru's freedom after kidnapping him. Bob, Kevin, and Stuart head to San Francisco to infiltrate Wild Knuckles' house to save Gru, but their disguises fail, leading to a chase through Chinatown. They are saved by Master Chow, and Kevin decides they should take kung fu lessons to help rescue Gru. Bob convinces Master Chow to train them by giving her puppy eyes, along with Kevin and Stuart.

                                During their training, Bob accidentally sneezes on the board he's meant to break, cutting it in half, and endures various objects dropped on his head by Master Chow, but emerges unscathed. However, their training is unsuccessful, and they remain in the junior level. Undeterred, the trio sets out to find Gru, who is tied to a clock by the now monstrous Vicious 6. In this encounter, Bob transforms into a goat.

                                Despite the chaos of the fight, they remember Master Chow's advice to unleash their "inner beast," allowing them to defeat the Vicious 6, just as Gru is freed by Otto, who transforms the villains into rats.

                                The next morning, Bob attends a staged funeral for Wild Knuckles with the rest of the Minion tribe, who is actually alive. Later, Bob uses his puppy eyes once again to help Gru successfully hire Dr. Nefario, and all the Minions join in the celebration as they ride on Gru's would-be airship.

                                Bob is a Minion known for being more childish and immature than many of his fellow Minions. He is often described as a "Little Brother" type, finding joy in everything around him, including a rat he named Poochy that he discovered in a sewer during the Minions film. Bob loves bedtime stories and enjoys playing with his favorite stuffed teddy bear, Tim.

                                In the audition scene of Despicable Me 2, Bob appears plumper, resembling the short and plump Minions with spiky hair, though he has no hair himself. Despite this, he remains playful and goofy, embodying the fun-loving spirit characteristic of all Minions.
