                                    Otto's first appearance is when Gru checks on the progress of his evil lair. Otto tries to comfort Gru, who is upset about not being accepted into the Vicious 6, but his constant blabbering leads Gru to distract him by playing the Quiet Game. Later, when Kevin, Stuart, and Bob try to follow Gru, who's heading to an interview with the Vicious 6, Otto is distracted by Kevin into playing Hide-and-Seek. He eventually finds them at Criminal Records and joins them on Gru's jet bike, though he falls off after hitting a staircase.
                                    
                                    At one point, Gru entrusts Otto with the important task of returning the Zodiac Stone to his lair. However, Otto becomes attached to the stone and gets tangled in its laces, falling face-first into concrete. After trying to pull it out, the stone flies into the air, and Otto catches it at a birthday party. Fascinated by a pet rock, Otto trades the Zodiac Stone for it, which results in the Minions being fired.
                                    
                                    The next day, Kevin, Stuart, and Bob confront Otto, and he admits to trading the stone. While outside, Otto spots someone wearing the stone around their neck and chases after them, eventually embarking on a journey to San Francisco to retrieve it. After securing the stone, Otto rides a Chinese dragon in search of Gru, but by the time he arrives, Gru has been captured by the Vicious 6. Otto hides but later helps free Gru during the final battle. Though he is briefly captured by Jean-Clawed, he is saved by Gru, and they escape from the tower. Otto is later seen at Wild Knuckles' funeral dressed as an angel and in the final scene, where Gru attempts to recruit Dr. Nefario to work for him.

                                    Otto was on the party bus, laughing when Kevin humorously thanked Mega Jerry by saying "pank you." He was also seen sitting with Benjamin in the final scene. Additionally, Otto appeared on a Despicable Me 4 poster in Japan.

                                    Otto makes a cameo in the Illumination Entertainment variant for Sing 2, as well as in crossover promos for The Super Mario Bros. Movie to help promote the film.

                                    Otto is known for being talkative, a motormouth, and easily distracted. This is evident when he becomes fascinated with the Pet Rock and trades it for the Zodiac Stone, later excitedly explaining the trade to Gru. His tendency to get sidetracked also highlights his somewhat dimwitted nature. To stop Otto from talking, one can either distract him with the "Quiet Game" (as young Gru does in Minions: The Rise of Gru) or by having him count in a game of hide-and-seek, then leaving him behind (a tactic used by Kevin, Bob, and Stuart in Minions: The Rise of Gru).

                                    Otto resembles Jerry but is rounder, taller, and a bit chubbier. He stands out with twelve tufts of hair and wears braces. Compared to the other Minions, he's noticeably larger in size. In Despicable Me 4, Otto's braces are removed.
